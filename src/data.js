Landing pages, forms, and pillar content (or any other one-stop-shop) are going to have high bounce rates. But, if your eCommerce site has a high bounce rate, you need to take some action. Why are your customers ditching your funnel mid-dance?"

To do this, you can start sending out surveys, looking into customer particulars, analyzing your products, and reviewing competitors in your space. Churn rate can also give you some critical insights into overall market trends."

	"moreInfo": "NPS is massive in B2B client interactions. If you can figure out where you’re both not aligning early (first 30 days) you can quickly save the relationships. Don’t just send an NPS survey out at the end of your client relationships, use it as a way to touch base throughout. NPS can be used as a retention hack that can save you some valuable customers. Want to get started? There are plenty of “free trial” NPS services out there that will give you a few for free. "
